# Kickstarter Project Analysis 

## Programs used: Excel & Pivot Tables

## Background 

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding resource where donors can donate to a variety of different projects of interest. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. This project consist of organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends. 

## Task 1 - Conditional Formatting and Column Manipulation

        (1) Edit the excel file to create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to uncover how much money a               campaign made to reach its initial goal.
        
        (2) Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. The scale                 should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.
        
        (3) Create a new column P called Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project             paid on average.
        
        (4) Create two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split             the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.

## Task 2 - Pivot Table Analysis 

        (1) Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were               successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.

        (2) Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of state, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the             count of state, and filters based on parent category and Years.
